# Density-Based-Traffic-Control-Using-Arduino-Microcontroller
The project was aimed at designing a density based traffic control system using Arduino and IR sensors. A four-junction based traffic control system was prototyped in the project. The vehicles were controlled using a microcontroller with the aid of the signal received from IR sensors.
The signal was controlled according to the number of vehicles that were sensed by the IR sensors positioned along the road.
